Tomorrow Work...

1) Meet with Ali (Related GET / issue)
2) Spam Protection Technique implementation
	-- Javascript Obfuscator method
	-- Sessions so bots can't submit through any software like CURl
	-- Stop same link adding to connections multiple times
3) Increase LinkCount when user click on any link in Profile Card
4) Turn Private Mode On/Off Api
5) Connections Read Api

Things in POPL:
	1) Won't allow user to submit more than once till page reload.
	2) Not Using form Tag.




What i did:
	1) Profile Card Served from backend now supports Private Functionality, that affects
		- Links not to show when private true
		- Exchange Contact Form not show when private true
		- Exchange Contact Form script not loads when private true
		- Hide Exchange Contact button from View

	2) Connection Read Api Created
		- Reason: Connections submitted from web form and we have no way to sync that with flutter app other than use web sockets (TCP connection that continuously listen for changes).

	3) Seperation of Business Clients links from Personal Links
		- toggle b/w two states and if businessClient is `true` then see only business links

	4) Visible Links Functionality added
		- links with property visibleOnProfile === true will only visible on profile card.

	5) Profile Card Adjusted so if user has no links, it will not show Exchange Contact button.

	6) popup-form is now responsive from 1600px to 280px

	7) cover-image ratio set
